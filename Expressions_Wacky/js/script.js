// A clown juggling invitational contest is being held at the circus. Clown posse's from all around
// will be coming in to compete. The organizers are trying to order supplies for the contest. To keep
// everything fair, the organizers are going to give each clown the same clown nose and juggling pins.
// They need to figure out how many clown noses and juggling pins to purchase to be able to give
// each clown the same amount. In addition, the clowns will be transported into the competition
// into clown cars that each posse of clowns came in. The organizers want to put an even amount
// of clowns into each clown car for show. The average needs to be found out
// how many clowns should be in each clown car.
